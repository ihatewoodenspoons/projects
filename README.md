Okay, so I'll explain what this whole entire 'projects' repository is all about.

Also, my release schedule sucks.

This was all created because I decided to begin learning C++. I'm mainly focusing on the calculator project.
Do not use this, as my code is:

* Highly unoptimized
* Buggy
* Design is horrible (I also need to learn ncurses).
* x64 only (no x86)
* Sucks at running on Windows

Anyway, peace out. I'll develop random projects every once in a while and add them under their own folder. 


* Do not look at any issues made by me, they are all extremely stupid.
